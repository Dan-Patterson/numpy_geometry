Point in Polygon implementation using winding numbers.  This is for Geo arrays
and uses numpy enhancements.

Purpose
-------
Functions for point partitioning and winding number inclusion tests for points
in polygons.

Notes
-----
**np_wn notes**

The polygon is represented as from-to pairs (fr_, to_).  Their x, y values
are obtained by translation and splitting (x0, y0, x1, y1).
The input points are processing in a similar fashion (pnts --> px, py).
The `winding number` is determined for all points at once for the given
polygon.

**pnts_in_Geo notes**

Pre-processing to remove duplicates or partition the points hasn't proved
to be optimal in all situations.  They are included for experimental
purposes.  In such cases, the process is as follows::

- Determine polygon extents for the Geo array `geo`.
- Derive the unique points for the test points `pnts`.
- Assign points to the appropriate extent.
- Run `winding number` algorithm (or `crossing number` if so inclined)
- Deleting points as you go does not improve things.

How to remove points from an array, if found in an array.  In the example below
`sub` is a subarray of `pnts`. The indices where they are equal is `w`.

>>> w = np.where((pnts == sub[:, None]).all(-1))[1]
>>> pnts = np.delete(pnts, w, 0)
